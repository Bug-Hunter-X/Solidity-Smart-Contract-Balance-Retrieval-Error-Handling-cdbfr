This repository demonstrates a common error in Solidity smart contracts related to balance retrieval and provides a solution for robust error handling. The bug.sol file contains the erroneous code, and bugSolution.sol offers a corrected version with improved error handling. The error arises from neglecting potential issues during balance retrieval, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The solution addresses this by incorporating appropriate error handling mechanisms to ensure the contract's reliability and security.
